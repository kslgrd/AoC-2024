# Advent of Code 2024

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.34. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.

I used [Devbox](https://www.jetify.com/docs/devbox/) to install Bun in an isolated shell.

To install dependencies:

```bash
devbox shell
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
# run the day1 code:
bun run day1.ts
```
